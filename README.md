dwn: Dritte Walpurgisnacht

repo to process data from Walpurgisnacht to use in a static website

mainly playing around to see if porting the current app [Karl Kraus 1933](https://kraus1933.ace.oeaw.ac.at/index.html) into a [dse-static-version](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dse-static-cookiecutter) is doable
